\section*{Problem 1}
\begin{solution}
    We run Prim's algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph
    with root \(d\) then the edges added to the MST are \(\{d,e\},\{e,g\},\{e,
    h\},\{b,e\},\{a,b\},\{a,c\},\{c,f\}\) from first to last respectively.
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 2}
\begin{solution}
    We can use a modified Prim's algorithm to find the maximum spanning tree
    of \(G\). We can find the greatest edge \(e\) instead of the lightest edge
    while keeping everything else in the algorithm the same. We can multiply
    the weight of every edge by \(-1\) and we can use \(-\infty\) instead of
    \(\infty\) in the priority queue. Therefore, when we remove a vertex with
    the highest priority in the queue we will choose the edge with the highest
    weight in the original graph. The time complexity of the modified Prim's
    algorithm is \(O(|V|\log|V|+|E|)\).
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 3}
\begin{solution}
    The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(|V|+|E|)\).
\end{solution}
\section*{Problem 4}
\begin{solution}
    The time complexity of the algorithm is \(O(|V|+|E|)\).
\end{solution}
